Hi!

As you already may know,
my name is Alexander I started coding when i was around 14 or 15 years old because of Minecraft servers.
I had my own server and tried to find ways to make it better.
I started by adding plugins that were made with Javascript (by other people).
And then i started making a website This already gave me the basic understandings of html and css and Javascript.

Unfortionately i thought coding wasn't "cool" enough for me so i stopped doing it, even though i loved it.

For my last year in High school i had to make a final project. I did it about my year as an exchange student in America. For this project i decided to make a blog from scratch to keep everybody up to date. It was around this time that I rediscovered how much i loved coding!
